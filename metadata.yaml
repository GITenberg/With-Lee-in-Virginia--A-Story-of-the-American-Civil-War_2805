description: "With Lee in Virginia, A Story of the American Civil War (1890) is a\
  \ book by British author G.A. Henty. It was published by Blackie and Son Ltd, London.\
  \ Henty's character, Vincent Wingfield, fights for the Confederate States of America,\
  \ even though he is against slavery. As suggested by the title, he is primarily\
  \ with the Army of Northern Virginia. Henty's novel has been cited by some literary\
  \ historians as an example of British right-wingers' sympathy for the Confederate\
  \ cause; discussing With Lee in Virginia, Jeffrey Richards cites the book as \"\
  significantly pro-Southern\". Henty defends slavery throughout the novel, stating\
  \ although slavery was capable of \"abominable\" cruelty under brutal masters, \"\
  ..taken all in all, the negroes on a well-ordered estate, under kind masters, were\
  \ probably a happier class of people than the laborers upon any estate in Europe.\"\
  \  At the novel's end, Henty has the Wingfield family's former slaves return and\
  \ continue working for their former owners:\n\nThe negroes, however, for the most\
  \ part remained steadily working on the estate. A few wandered away, but their places\
  \ were easily filled; for the majority of the freed slaves very soon discovered\
  \ that their lot was a far harder one than it had been before, and that freedom\
  \ so suddenly given was a curse rather than a blessing to them. \n\nRichards cites\
  \ the novel as an example of Henty's belief in the \"incapacity\" of blacks and\
  \ notes that With Lee In Virginia argues that \"a system of slavery is acceptable\
  \ so long as the slave owners treat their slaves decently and humanely\".  Nathaniel\
  \ Cadle claims With Lee in Virginia's plot works to \"romanticize and oversimplify\
  \ the relationship between white Confederate slave owners and their black chattel.\"\
  \nThe book has been lauded by the right-wing, Neo-Confederate magazine Southern\
  \ Partisan, who described With Lee in Virginia as \"the sort of book Southern Partisan\
  \ readers ought to pass on to their own sons. The politics of sectional conflict\
  \ aren't oversimplified, but the bias is one Southern Partisan readers are likely\
  \ to applaud\".\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
